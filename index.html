        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I am pursuing a 5-year BS-MS dual degree in Science, focusing on Biology and Data Science. My passion lies in integrating computational or data science approaches with cancer research and target therapy. I am currently building my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision while being proficient in multiplex image analysis using AI-ML based softwares and advanced genomics techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. These are complemented by a strong foundation in molecular biology techniques and bioinformatics. My goal is to leverage computational studies to advance cancer research.</p>

        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single Cell RNA seq analysis using Python to study the co-expression patterns of YAP and TAZ in breast cancer tissues</strong><br><em>Intern Researcher, Tumor Microenvironment Lab and Leelavati Lab, IISER Pune</em> (Aug 2024 - Jan 2025)<br><em>Studied the co-expression patterns of YAP and TAZ in breast cancer cells and normal mammary epithelial cells by single-cell RNA sequence data analysis using Python to investigate their level of functional redundancy and unique roles. The project involved developing a single cell analysis pipeline for the lab from scratch.</li>
            <li><strong>Image analysis to study the expression patterns of THBS1 in breast cancer patient samples using Multiplex-IF</strong><br><em>Intern Researcher, Tumor Microenvironment Lab, IISER Pune</em> (Jan 2024 - Aug 2024)<br><em>I studied the expression pattern of THBS1 in different cell types of patient tumor samples using PanCK and CD3 as cell type markers for multiplex-IF and performed multiplex image analysis using Halo and inForm software</li>
            <li><strong>Producing sustainable aviation fuel from Jatropha Curcas Oil using Yarrowia Lipolytica as chassis</strong><br><em>Head of Wet Lab and Measurements, iGEM IISER Pune 2023</em> (Feb 2023 - Nov 2023)<be><em>I led the Wet Lab team, focusing on gene knockouts, and served as the measurements head. I was responsible for designing and planning the daily experiments and was heavily involved in getting the final proof of concept. I was also involved in computation-based studies and designed the conditions needed for optimal production using statistical learning and DoE. We secured the Best Education Award was nominated for Best Climate Crisis Project, and achieved a top-10 global rank among undergraduate teams</li>
